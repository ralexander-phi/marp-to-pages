# Deploy Marp to GitHub Pages

Presentations to Webpages: Instantly!

## What?

[Marp](https://marp.app/) lets you create HTML slides from markdown (like this!).

This presentation is both a [website](https://alexsci.com/marp-to-pages) and a [README.md](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/marp-to-pages/blob/main/README.md).

## Why?

Treat your presentation the same way you treat code.

- Use git to track changes
- Pull requests to collaborate
- Deploy automatically
- See a problem? Open an issue!

## Setup

Want to create your own?

First, create a new repo [from the template repo](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/marp-to-pages).

## Configure GitHub Pages

Open your new repo and [setup publishing](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).

You'll typically use `gh-pages` as the deploy branch.

## Review Build

Click on Actions tab and see if the build succeeded (it may take some time).

You should now see the generated files in the `gh-pages` branch.

## View webpage

Open your deployed webpage to see the content.

Out of the box you should see `README.md` as `/index.html` and `/README.pdf`. Slides under `docs/` are also converted.

## Running locally

Locally you'll run commands like:

```
$ marp README.md -o build/README.pdf
```

or

```
$ npx @marp-team/marp-cli@latest README.md -o build/README.pdf
```

## As a workflow step

The workflow runs an equivalent step:

```
- name: Marp Build (README.pdf)
  uses: docker://marpteam/marp-cli:v1.7.0
  with:
    args: README.md -o build/README.pdf
  env:
    MARP_USER: root:root
```

Note the `args` match the previous slide.

## Customizing the build

Anything in the `build/` folder will be deployed to GitHub Pages.

You can copy extra files or run further processing steps using other tools.
